# Simple Java Addition Program

This is a simple command-line Java application that prompts the user to enter two whole numbers and then adds them together.

## Features

- User-friendly prompts
- Input validation to ensure numbers are whole integers
- Displays the result of the addition in a readable format

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the first number.
2. It validates the input to ensure it's a valid integer.
3. It repeats the process for the second number.
4. It then adds the two numbers and displays the result.

## Example

```
Enter your first number  
10  
Enter your second number  
25  
10 + 25 = 35
```

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

## How to Run

1. Save the code in a file named `Main.java`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   ```

4. Run the program:

   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

## Notes

- If the user enters a non-integer (like "abc" or "5.6"), the program will prompt again until valid input is received.
- This project demonstrates basic Java concepts such as:
  - Variables and data types
  - Exception handling (`try-catch`)
  - Methods and input validation
  - Using the `Scanner` class for input
